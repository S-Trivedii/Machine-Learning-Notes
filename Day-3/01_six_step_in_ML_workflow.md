# Understanding the Six Steps of a Machine Learning Workflow

This document outlines the standard six-step process followed in most machine learning (ML) projects. Each step plays a crucial role in building effective and generalizable models.

## 1. Get Data

- Collect relevant data from various sources (CSV, APIs, databases, etc.)
- Preprocess the data (cleaning, normalization, encoding, handling missing values)

## 2. Define the Hypothesis Space

- Choose a model type (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks)
- This determines the set of all possible functions the model can learn

## 3. Define a Loss Function

- Loss functions measure how well a hypothesis (model) performs
- Common examples: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross-Entropy, Hinge Loss

## 4. Choose a Learning Algorithm

- This is where optimization techniques come into play
- The algorithm explores the hypothesis space to minimize the loss

## 5. Train the Model (Run the Algorithm)

- Feed the data into the model
- Use the learning algorithm to adjust parameters and minimize the loss

## 6. Validate the Result

- Test the model on unseen (validation/test) data
- Evaluate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

By repeating these steps and tuning parameters, one can build a robust ML model.
