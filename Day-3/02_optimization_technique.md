# What Does It Mean to Find the Best Learning Algorithm?

When we say **"find the best learning algorithm"** in machine learning, we are essentially referring to selecting the **right optimization technique** that can efficiently train the model.

## 🔍 What Is a Learning Algorithm?

A learning algorithm adjusts the model parameters (like weights in a neural network) using training data in order to minimize a loss function.

## ⚙️ What Is an Optimization Technique?

An optimization technique is a method that the learning algorithm uses to minimize the loss function and improve model accuracy.

It’s the **engine** that powers the learning algorithm.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The objective is to find the best set of parameters that:

- Minimize the loss function
- Generalize well to new, unseen data

---

## 🧠 Common Optimization Techniques

- Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Adam Optimizer
- RMSProp
- Genetic Algorithms
- Bayesian Optimization (often for hyperparameter tuning)

---

## 🧪 Example

Imagine you're training a linear regression model:

- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimization Technique: Gradient Descent
- The algorithm updates weights to reduce MSE

Choosing the right optimization technique can significantly impact the speed and quality of model training.
