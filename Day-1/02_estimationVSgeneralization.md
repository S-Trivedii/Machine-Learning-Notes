## 🟩 🔍 Estimation → Focus: Fitting the data you already have

“Can I make a good guess based on what I’ve already seen?”

- It’s about **handling noise and variability** in your current data.

- For example:

  - You measure someone’s height 5 times and get slightly different values.
  - Estimation means averaging those to get the best estimate of their real height.

- ML example:
  - Predicting house prices based on 100 past sales → you fit a model that works well on those 100.

## 🟦 🚀 Generalization → Focus: Performing well on new, unseen data

“Can I make a good guess on **data I haven’t seen before?”**

- It’s about whether your model can **apply what it learned** to new situations.

- For example:

  - You train a face recognition model on 1,000 images.
  - Generalization is: Does it work well on new faces not in those 1,000?

- ML example:
  - Your model predicts house prices well on training data — but does it predict prices **correctly for future houses?**

## Example of Estimation and Generalization

### 🟢 Estimation:

“I measured the same person’s height 5 times. The results vary a bit. Now I want to estimate their height for the 6th time.”

- ✅ You're using past, noisy data of the same case
- ✅ Trying to get the best average guess
- ✅ This is estimation.

### 🔵 Generalization:

“I saw 6 height measurements of one person. Now a **new person** comes, and I want to predict their height.”

- ✅ This is a new case
- ✅ You’re using patterns learned from the first person to predict something for someone else
- ✅ This is generalization.
