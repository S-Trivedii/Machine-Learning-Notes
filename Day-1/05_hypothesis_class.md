## What is a Hypothesis class ?

✅ Definition:
The hypothesis class is the set of all models (or functions) your learning algorithm is allowed to choose from to make predictions.

📦 Think of it like a toolbox:
Imagine you have a toolbox filled with different types of tools (models).
When training a machine learning model, you can only pick your final tool (model) **from this toolbox** — this toolbox is your **hypothesis class**.

🔍 Example:
Suppose you're doing regression and your hypothesis class is:

```bash
H = { y = w₀ + w₁x | for all real values of w₀ and w₁ }
where H stands for hypothesis class
```

This means:
👉 You’re only allowing the model to pick from **straight-line equations** (linear models).
You’re not allowing curves, polynomials, or decision trees — **just straight lines.**

## 💡 Why is it important?

- If your **hypothesis class is too simple** (e.g., only straight lines), it might **underfit.**

- If it’s too **complex** (e.g., deep neural networks when not needed), it might **overfit.**

So, choosing the right hypothesis class is important to balance between bias and variance.

## 🧠 In short:

The hypothesis class is the set of all possible functions (models) the learning algorithm can choose from during training.

## So, models are nothing but function?

✅ Yes — models are functions.
In machine learning:

A **model** is essentially just a **function** that maps input data (X) to output predictions (Y).

🔍 Think of it like this:

- You give some input x (like an image, song, or person's info).

- The model (function) takes that input and returns a prediction y (like a label, rating, or decision).
